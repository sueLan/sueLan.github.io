`xcrun simctl` is command utils to control iOS simulator, just like  [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb?hl=en) for Android. Sometimes, in CI server script, We need these simulator-integration command to interact with simulators and run test cases. 

 If we run `xcrun simctl help`, here are some subcommands. When successful, most of these commands exit with 0; when failed, most exit with a non-zero number. 

```
Subcommands:
        create              Create a new device.
        clone               Clone an existing device.
        upgrade             Upgrade a device to a newer runtime.
        delete              Delete spcified devices, unavailable devices, or all devices.

        io                  Set up a device IO operation.
        diagnose            Collect diagnostic information and logs.
        logverbose          enable or disable verbose logging for a device
        status_bar          Set or clear status bar overrides
```
Just see I can do a lot of things with these command. If wanting to know more about a specific subcommand, we can use `xcrun simctl help [subcommand]` to seek help. Like, `xcrun simctl help boot` 


### Simulator info 

use `xcrun simctl list` to see all the simulator information. We can get a list of device types, a list of info of runtime names, a list of device names. 
  
```
== Device Types ==
iPhone 11 Pro (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-11-Pro)
iPhone 11 Pro Max (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iP

== Runtimes ==
iOS 13.3 (13.3 - 17C45) - com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-3 

== Devices ==
-- iOS 13.3 --
iPhone 11 Pro Max (34C9AC6A-577D-4CEF-8B10-20011DCFBA27) (Shutdown) 
```

Use `xcrun simctl list device` to see the list of device info. Or use a device name to get paired devices' info, like name, uuid, and status. For example,  

```
xcrun simctl list devices "iPhone 11 Pro Max"
```

```
== Devices ==
-- iOS 12.4 --
-- iOS 13.3 --
    iPhone 11 Pro Max (34C9AC6A-577D-4CEF-8B10-20011DCFBA27) (Shutdown) 
-- tvOS 13.3 --
-- watchOS 6.1 --
-- Unavailale: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-0 --
    iPhone 11 Pro Max (893827B6-91E0-417C-A179-68343F695040) (Creating) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)
-- Unavailable: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-1 --
    iPhone 11 Pro Max (F4B573E0-4106-4FF2-ADA8-16DCC053026C) (Shutdown) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)
-- Unavailable: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-2 --
    iPhone 11 Pro Max (B63C96BD-1CE2-499B-8387-3B8AEBF50931) (Creating) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)
```



### Create a custom simulator


`xcrun simctl create <name> <device type> <runtime>`
For example, if I would like to create a iPhone 11 Pro Max with iOS 13.3, I can use the follow command.

```
xcrun simctl create "ry" "iPhone 11 Pro Max" iOS13.3  
BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5 
```



The `uuid` of the new simulator is `BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5`, which is output in standard out. And errors comes to standard error. 

> Tips: you should use available runtime, or you will get an error of `invalid runtime: xxx`. 

If in shell scrip, we can capture the new device's name using environment variable:

```
NEW_DEVICE=$(xcrun simctl create "Test Phone" "iPhone XR" iOS13.0)
echo "ü§ñ Created ${NEW_DEVICE}"
ü§ñ Created BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5
```

Another way to create a simulator using GUI is to go to `Window` -> `Devices and Simulators`

### Boot a simulator 

Boot a device using `$uuid` 

`xcrun simctl boot BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5` 

Use `simctl shutdown <device>` to shutdown a device. 

### Install/Uninstall app 

`xcrun simctl install <device> <path>`. We use this command to install an app on a device. 

```
‚ûú  xcrun simctl install booted ./demo.app
```

 `booted` is the alias name of the booted device. We can also use `uuid` of a device.

 use ` simctl uninstall <device> <app bundle identifier>` to uninstall an app. like 
 `xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo`  

### Launch 

`xcrun simctl launch <device> <bundle> <arguments>`. 

Launch command is used to launch a application in your simulator device.

```
xcrun simctl launch booted com.apple.example -MyDefaultKey YES
```

`com.apple.example` is bundle id of the application. 

If we use `--console-pty`,  launch command will connect the standard output and error of the application to the terminal line.

```
‚ûú  xcrun simctl launch --console-pty booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo

com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo: 98045
2020-02-09 10:38:28.594 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] gesture end translation x -281.000000; velocity-1056.111584
2020-02-09 10:38:28.594 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -281.000332
2020-02-09 10:38:28.611 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -285.030635
2020-02-09 10:38:28.627 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -289.060938
```


 Use `xcrun simctl terminate <device> <bundle>` to terminate an application by identifier on a device.
### Container Path 

`xcrun simctl simctl get_app_container <device> <app bundle identifier> [<container>]`  command is used to get the path of the installed app's container.  

```
container   Optionally specify the container. Defaults to app.
  app                 The .app bundle
  data                The application's data container
  groups              The App Group containers
  <group identifier>  A specific App Group container
```


For example

```
‚ûú xcrun simctl get_app_container booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo 
~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5/data/Containers/Bundle/Application/135A7B46-DE38-47EC-9871-D1F3615E9CE5/3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo.app
‚ûú xcrun simctl get_app_container booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo data 
~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5/data/Containers/Data/Application/10D64231-20B5-4DFE-B1E9-277AD9C02C4F
```

### Spawn 

Spawn command will pause xspawn, a process inside the simulator environment. 

```
xcrun simctl spawn booted defaults write com.example.app ResetDatabase -bool YES
```
Here, we use `defaults` utils, because we already have a booted device `BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5`, we don't have to specify the device. 

`com.example.app` is bundle id of my application. We reset `ResetDatabase` to YES. 
This is a handy way to change the user defaults for the application before its running.  

### Log Stream 

spwan command would work with log stream utility. We can pass a predicate and filter the log output. Here the predicate is `senderImagePath CONTAINS "nsurlsessiond"`. We can debug something wrong with URL session. 

```
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'senderImagePath CONTAINS "nsurlsessiond"'
```
![spwan](spawn_log.png)

Also, we can use different predicates to filter what we want.  

```
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream ‚Äî predicate ‚ÄòprocessImagePath endswith ‚Äúxxx‚Äù‚Äô
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream ‚Äî predicate ‚ÄòeventMessage contains ‚Äúerror‚Äù and messageType == info‚Äô

```


### Dignose 

In a auto-test system, if having some kind of issue, by using this command, you can not only collect logs on disk but also capture ephemeral logging and dump system state. 

```
‚ûú  xcrun simctl diagnose -l

```

### Clone 
Clone is a very powerful command. See details in [wwdc2019/418](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/418/).  

`xcrun simctl clone <device> <clone name>`.  You can copy your custom device using this command. 

```
// boot base simulator ry
‚ûú xcrun simctl boot ry   
‚ûú xcrun simctl install ry ./demo.app
// Must shutdown it before clone 
‚ûú xcrun simctl shutdown all 
‚ûú xcrun simctl clone ry ry-1  
‚ûú xcrun simctl clone ry ry-2 
‚ûú xcrun simctl boot ry-1 && xcrun simctl boot ry-2 
```


Two new devices are created with the same contents.

### Other useful commands

```
// Open a URL in a device.
simctl openurl <device> <URL>
// add a photo or movie to the Photos library of the specified simulator 
xcrun simctl addmedia <device> <file1> <file2>
// Set up a device IO operation. screenshot or recordVideo 
xcrun simctl io <device> screenshot <output.png>
xcrun simctl io <device> recordVideo <file>
