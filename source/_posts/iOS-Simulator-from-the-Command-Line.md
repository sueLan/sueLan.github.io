`xcrun simctl` is command utils to control iOS simulator, just like  [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb?hl=en) for Android. Sometimes, in CI server script, We need these simulator-integration command to interact with simulators and run test cases. 

 If we run `xcrun simctl help`, here are some subcommands. When successful, most of these commands exit with 0; when failed, most exit with a non-zero number. 

```
Subcommands:
        create              Create a new device.

        keychain            Manipulate a device's keychain
```
Just see I can do a lot of things with these command. If wanting to know more about a specific subcommand, we can use `xcrun simctl help [subcommand]` to seek help. Like, `xcrun simctl help boot` 


### Simulator info 

use `xcrun simctl list` to see all the simulator information. We can get a list of device types, a list of info of runtime names, a list of device names. 
  
```
== Device Types ==
iPhone 11 Pro (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-11-Pro)
iPhone 11 Pro Max (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iP

== Runtimes ==
iOS 13.3 (13.3 - 17C45) - com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-3 

== Devices ==
-- iOS 13.3 --
iPhone 11 Pro Max (34C9AC6A-577D-4CEF-8B10-20011DCFBA27) (Shutdown) 
```

Use `xcrun simctl list device` to see the list of device info. Or use a device name to get paired devices' info, like name, uuid, and status. For example,  

```
xcrun simctl list devices "iPhone 11 Pro Max"
```

```
== Devices ==
-- iOS 12.4 --
-- iOS 13.3 --
    iPhone 11 Pro Max (34C9AC6A-577D-4CEF-8B10-20011DCFBA27) (Shutdown) 
-- tvOS 13.3 --
-- watchOS 6.1 --
-- Unavailale: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-0 --
    iPhone 11 Pro Max (893827B6-91E0-417C-A179-68343F695040) (Creating) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)
-- Unavailable: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-1 --
    iPhone 11 Pro Max (F4B573E0-4106-4FF2-ADA8-16DCC053026C) (Shutdown) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)
-- Unavailable: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-2 --
    iPhone 11 Pro Max (B63C96BD-1CE2-499B-8387-3B8AEBF50931) (Creating) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)
```

### Get device environment variable 

`xcrun simctl getenv` is for printing an environment variable from a running device. 

```
Usage: simctl getenv <device> <variable name>
```


Take the follow command as an example, the `SIMULATOR_UDID` environment variable contains the UDID of the simulated device. But it doesn't work for physical device. 

```
xcrun simctl getenv booted SIMULATOR_UDID
9362BF90-132F-4894-A057-CEBFEC9C1FB6
```

We can add more environment variables by ourselves in schema for debugging use.

[Launch Arguments & Environment Variables](https://nshipster.com/launch-arguments-and-environment-variables/)

### Create a custom simulator


`xcrun simctl create <name> <device type> <runtime>`
For example, if I would like to create a iPhone 11 Pro Max with iOS 13.3, I can use the follow command.

```
xcrun simctl create "ry" "iPhone 11 Pro Max" iOS13.3  
BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5 
```



The `uuid` of the new simulator is `BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5`, which is output in standard out. And errors comes to standard error. 

> Tips: you should use available runtime, or you will get an error of `invalid runtime: xxx`. 

If in shell scrip, we can capture the new device's name using environment variable:

```
NEW_DEVICE=$(xcrun simctl create "Test Phone" "iPhone XR" iOS13.0)
echo "ü§ñ Created ${NEW_DEVICE}"
ü§ñ Created BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5
```

Another way to create a simulator using GUI is to go to `Window` -> `Devices and Simulators` 

![create](create.png)
 ¬†¬†
### Boot a simulator 

Boot a device using `$uuid` 

`xcrun simctl boot BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5` 

Use `simctl shutdown <device>` to shutdown a device. 

### Install/Uninstall app 

`xcrun simctl install <device> <path>`. We use this command to install an app on a device. 

```
‚ûú  xcrun simctl install booted ./demo.app
```

 `booted` is the alias name of the booted device. We can also use `uuid` of a device.

 use ` simctl uninstall <device> <app bundle identifier>` to uninstall an app. like 
 `xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo`  

### Launch 

`xcrun simctl launch <device> <bundle> <arguments>`. 

Launch command is used to launch a application in your simulator device.

```
xcrun simctl launch booted com.apple.example -MyDefaultKey YES
```

`com.apple.example` is bundle id of the application. 

If we use `--console-pty`,  launch command will connect the standard output and error of the application to the terminal line.

```
‚ûú  xcrun simctl launch --console-pty booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo

com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo: 98045
2020-02-09 10:38:28.594 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] gesture end translation x -281.000000; velocity-1056.111584
2020-02-09 10:38:28.594 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -281.000332
2020-02-09 10:38:28.611 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -285.030635
2020-02-09 10:38:28.627 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -289.060938
```


 Use `xcrun simctl terminate <device> <bundle>` to terminate an application by identifier on a device.
### Container Path 

`xcrun simctl simctl get_app_container <device> <app bundle identifier> [<container>]`  command is used to get the path of the installed app's container.  

```
container   Optionally specify the container. Defaults to app.
  app                 The .app bundle
  data                The application's data container
  groups              The App Group containers
  <group identifier>  A specific App Group container
```


For example

```
‚ûú xcrun simctl get_app_container booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo 
~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5/data/Containers/Bundle/Application/135A7B46-DE38-47EC-9871-D1F3615E9CE5/3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo.app
‚ûú xcrun simctl get_app_container booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo data 
~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5/data/Containers/Data/Application/10D64231-20B5-4DFE-B1E9-277AD9C02C4F
```

### Spawn 

Spawn command will pause xspawn, a process inside the simulator environment. 

```
xcrun simctl spawn booted defaults write com.example.app ResetDatabase -bool YES
```
Here, we use `defaults` utils, because we already have a booted device `BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5`, we don't have to specify the device. 

`com.example.app` is bundle id of my application. We reset `ResetDatabase` to YES. 
This is a handy way to change the user defaults for the application before its running.  

### Log Stream 

spwan command would work with log stream utility. We can pass a predicate and filter the log output. Here the predicate is `senderImagePath CONTAINS "nsurlsessiond"`. We can debug something wrong with URL session. 

```
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'senderImagePath CONTAINS "nsurlsessiond"'
```
![spwan](spawn_log.png)

Also, we can use different predicates to filter what we want.  

```
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream ‚Äî predicate ‚ÄòprocessImagePath endswith ‚Äúxxx‚Äù‚Äô
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream ‚Äî predicate ‚ÄòeventMessage contains ‚Äúerror‚Äù and messageType == info‚Äô

```


### Dignose 

In a auto-test system, if having some kind of issue, by using this command, you can not only collect logs on disk but also capture ephemeral logging and dump system state. 

```
‚ûú  xcrun simctl diagnose -l                              
Writing to /private/tmp/simctl_diagnose_2020_02_09.10-10-56+0800

```

![diagnose](diagnose.png)

### Clone 
Clone is a very powerful command. See details in [wwdc2019/418](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/418/).  

`xcrun simctl clone <device> <clone name>`.  You can copy your custom device using this command. 

```
// boot base simulator ry
‚ûú xcrun simctl boot ry   
‚ûú xcrun simctl install ry ./demo.app
// Must shutdown it before clone 
‚ûú xcrun simctl shutdown all 
‚ûú xcrun simctl clone ry ry-1  
‚ûú xcrun simctl clone ry ry-2 
‚ûú xcrun simctl boot ry-1 && xcrun simctl boot ry-2 
```


Two new devices are created with the same contents. 

![clone](clone.png)


### Push Notification to simulator

1. Create a `.apns` file, `ExamplePush.apns` 

```
{
    "Simulator Target Bundle": "com.facebook.flipper",
    "aps": {
        "alert": "This is a simulated notification!",
        "badge": 3,
        "sound": "default"
    }
}
```

[valid Apple Push Notification values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification). Noted that the `Target Bundle` should be the same as the `bundle identifier`  

2. Drag and drop an APNs file onto the target simulator. 

> The file must be a JSON file with a valid Apple Push Notification Service payload, including the ‚Äúaps‚Äù key. It must also contain a top-level ‚ÄúSimulator Target Bundle‚Äù with a string value matching the target application‚Äòs bundle identifier. --  https://stackoverflow.com/a/60085404/4026902



Or, we use command lines. 

```
xcrun simctl push booted com.facebook.flipper ExamplePush.apns
```


```
‚ûú  ~ xcrun simctl push 
Send a simulated push notification
Usage: simctl push <device> [<bundle identifier>] (<json file> | -)

        bundle identifier
             The bundle identifier of the target application
             If the payload file contains a 'Simulator Target Bundle' top-level key this parameter may be omitted.
             If both are provided this argument will override the value from the payload.
        json file
             Path to a JSON payload or '-' to read from stdin. The payload must:
               - Contain an object at the top level.
               - Contain an 'aps' key with valid Apple Push Notification values.
               - Be 4096 bytes or less.

Only application remote push notifications are supported. VoIP, Complication, File Provider, and other types are not supported.

```

### Manipulate a device's keychain 

```
‚ûú  ~ xcrun simctl keychain
Manipulate a device's keychain
Usage: simctl keychain <device> <action> [arguments]

    add-root-cert [path]
        Add a certificate to the trusted root store.

    add-cert [path]
        Add a certificate to the keychain.

    reset
        Reset the keychain.
```

```
xcrun simctl keychain booted add-root-cert myCA.cer
```

### Privacy and Permissions 

These commands, introduced in Xcode 11.4,  could be very useful when you are developing some features and have to test the permissions.  

```
‚ûú  ~ xcrun simctl privacy                                         
Grant, revoke, or reset privacy and permissions
Usage: simctl privacy <device> <action> <service> [<bundle identifier>]

        action
             The action to take:
                 grant - Grant access without prompting. Requires bundle identifier.
                 revoke - Revoke access, denying all use of the service. Requires bundle identifier.
                 reset - Reset access, prompting on next use. Bundle identifier optional.
             Some permission changes will terminate the application if running.
        service
             The service:
                 all - Apply the action to all services.
                 calendar - Allow access to calendar.
                 contacts-limited - Allow access to basic contact info.
                 contacts - Allow access to full contact details.
                 location - Allow access to location services when app is in use.
                 location-always - Allow access to location services at all times.
                 photos-add - Allow adding photos to the photo library.
                 photos - Allow full access to the photo library.
                 media-library - Allow access to the media library.
                 microphone - Allow access to audio input.
                 motion - Allow access to motion and fitness data.
                 reminders - Allow access to reminders.
                 siri - Allow use of the app with Siri.
        bundle identifier
             The bundle identifier of the target application.

Examples:
        reset all permissions: privacy <device> reset all
        grant test host photo permissions: privacy <device> grant photos com.example.app.test-host
```
For example,

```
‚ûú  ~ xcrun simctl privacy booted grant location com.facebook.flipper
‚ûú  ~ xcrun simctl privacy booted grant photos com.facebook.flipper
```

and use `revoke` to revoke the permissions. 


### Switch the appearance style in a device between light and dark.

```
xcrun simctl ui booted appearance dark
xcrun simctl ui booted appearance light
```

### StatsBar override 

`Usage: simctl status_bar <device> [list | clear | override <override arguments>]`

It seems it can support a lot of overrides variables in status bar. But I have figure out the scenarios to use them. 

```
‚ûú  ~ xcrun simctl status_bar                                    
Set or clear status bar overrides
Usage: simctl status_bar <device> [list | clear | override <override arguments>]

Supported Operations:
    list
        List existing overrides.

    clear
        Clear all existing status bar overrides.

    override <override arguments>
        Set status bar override values, according to these flags.
        You may specify any combination of these flags (at least one is required):

        --time <string>
             Set the date or time to a fixed value.
             If the string is a valid ISO date string it will also set the date on relevant devices.
        --dataNetwork <dataNetworkType>
             If specified must be one of 'wifi', '3g', '4g', 'lte', 'lte-a', or 'lte+'.
        --wifiMode <mode>
             If specified must be one of 'searching', 'failed', or 'active'.
        --wifiBars <int>
             If specified must be 0-3.
        --cellularMode <mode>
             If specified must be one of 'notSupported', 'searching', 'failed', or 'active'.
        --cellularBars <int>
             If specified must be 0-4.
        --operatorName <string>
             Set the cellular operator/carrier name. Use '' for the empty string.
        --batteryState <state>
             If specified must be one of 'charging', 'charged', or 'discharging'.
        --batteryLevel <int>
             If specified must be 0-100.
```

```
// change the `dataNetwork` from `wifi` to `4g`
‚ûú  ~ xcrun simctl status_bar booted override --dataNetwork '4g'
```

```
xcrun simctl status_bar booted override --time 15:42 --cellularBars 1 --dataNetwork '3g' --wifiMode 'failed' --batteryState 'charging'
```
![status bar](status_bar_test.png)

and use `clear` option to clear all the settings.

```
xcrun simctl status_bar booted clear
```

https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10647/

### Record Video 

We can run `xcrun simctl io --help` to see more. 

```
xcrun simctl io <device> recordVideo <file>
```

```
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo video.mp4
```
This command records the content of the screen of the current booted simulator, and save it to the video.mp4 file.  To stop recording, we have to use `ctl+c` in the terminal. 

```
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo  -f video.mp4
```
`recordVideo` cannot save recorded video output into a file that already exists unless we use  `-f` flag to override the existing file. 

```
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo video.mp4 --codec h264 --mask ignored video.mp4
```
 - By default, codec type is `hevc`. 
 - Ignore the mask when the mask is rendered black because of compatibility issues. 


And we can also capture the out of the external display of the simulator. 
```
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo --display external external.mp4 
```

![](record_video.gif)

### Other useful commands

```
// Open a URL in a device.
simctl openurl <device> <URL>
// add a photo or movie to the Photos library of the specified simulator 
xcrun simctl addmedia <device> <file1> <file2>
// Set up a device IO operation. screenshot or recordVideo 
xcrun simctl io <device> screenshot <output.png>
