For example, choose `Show tab named` , fill in the name and choose `active window` . We will have a independent debug tab. \n\n![image-20200601222857985](412/image-20200601222857985.png)\n\n\n\n<img src=\"media/15902152252875/image-20200607112605302.png\" alt=\"image-20200607112605302\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\n## LLDB expressions can modify program state\n\nBy using  auto-continuing breakpoints with debugger commands to inject code live, you can inject expression, change state or logic without compiling the project.  \n\n**How to do it? **\n\n- Click `Edit BreakPoint...`\n\n- Click `add action` ; the default option is `Debugger Command`  we can write some `LLDB` command here\n\n- Choose the `Automatically continue`, it will not pause when trigger this breakpoint. \n\n  \n\n  <img src=\"media/15902152252875/image-20200607111532596.png\" alt=\"image-20200607111532596\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"media/15902152252875/image-20200601224246210.png\" alt=\"image-20200601224246210\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\n\n\n## Symbolic Breakpoint \n\n`Symbolic Breakpoint` is one of my favorite tools to debug issues caused by others' framework.\n\nIn the  `Breakpoint navigator` , choose `Symbolic Breakpoint` .  \n\n<img src=\"412/image-20200607113135963.png\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\nFill in any signature of the `Objective-c` method you want. \n\n<img src=\"412/image-20200607113105829.png\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\n## “po $arg1” ($arg2, etc) in assembly frames to print function arguments\n\n<img src=\"412/image-20200601224622911.png\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\nIn this case,  we use `Symbolic Breakpoint` to hit the `setText:` in `UILabe`, but we don't have the source code of `UIKit`. When the method is hit, we are in an assembly frame, we can use `$arg` to inspect the parameters.  `$arg1` is `self` pointer. `$arg2` is the  `selector` of the method. Others are  arguements to the method.

And then, this `Breakppint` will be hit only when the expression for the condition is true.  However, when we don't a property to make the `condition expression`.   There is another way.  We can add action `one-shot symbolic breakpoint` in `a specific breakpoint`, where it will be hit only once in the proper time. \n\n>  The one shot breakpoint is a temporary breakpoint that only exists until it's triggered and then it's automatically deleted.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"media/15902152252875/image-20200607115734569.png\" alt=\"image-20200607115734569\" style=\"zoom:67%;\" />\n\n- Set  a break point in line 96, where we might don't want a break, but we can `configure this breakpoint` to actually set the `symbolic breakpoint` in UI label set text . \n- choose `automatically continue` \n\n- Then add action , `breakpoint set --one-shot true --name \"[UILabel setText:]\"`.  This `one-shot symbolic breakpoint` is activated only after this breakpoint in line 96 is hit.  \n\n\n\nHow magical the dependent breakpoints are!\n\n\n\n## Skip lines of code \n\nBy `dragging` Instruction Pointer, the green handler in the following picture,  we can skip lines of code.

So here comes ``expression -l objc -O -- <expr>`.  This can help use them as we do in obj-c frames.  \n\n```\n// In swift\nexpression -l objc -O -- [`self.view`  recursiveDescription]\n\n// In Obj-c \n[self.view  recursiveDescription]\n```\n\nBy using the  `command alis` , we can short cut it. \n\n```\ncommand alis poc expression -l -objc -O --\n```\n\n![image-20200607141219843](media/15902152252875/image-20200607141219843.png)\n\n\n\n## Flush view changes to the screen using “expression CATransaction.flush()”\n\n#### unsafeBitCast\n\nWe can use `unsafeBitCast`  in Swift.  To do the type cast, we have to provide the correct type. \n\nPrint its property or change its property: \n\n![image-20200607142019406](media/15902152252875/image-20200607142019406.png)\n\nUse `CATransaction.flush` to apply the view module changes to the screen's frame buffer. \n\n## Add custom LLDB commands using aliases and scripts.

For example, a variable might be declared using a protocol of this type. In this example, the static type of `cruise` is `Activity`. But at runtime, the variable will have an instance of type `Trip` which is the dynamic time. If we print the value of `cruise`, we get back an object of type `Trip` because LLDB retell results metadata to display the most accurate type for a given variable at a given program point. This is what we call `dynamic type resolution`.\n\nWith the p-command, dynamic type resolution is `only` performed on the result of the `expression`.\n\nThis happens because if you remember, LLDB compiles code where running p and the only type it sees is the one in your source code, the static one. It's the same thing as typing the expression `cruise.name` in your source code. The static compiler will reject it with an error.  ![-w1104](15902348043124.jpg?lastModify=1591521218)\n\nIf you want to evaluate the expression without errors, you need to first cast the object explicitly to its dynamic type and then access the field on the result.

While in iOS, there is something similar called `anchor point`. \n\n`Anchor point` in a view is a point in the unit coordinate space, about which all geometric manipulations to the view occur. \n\n> Defines the anchor point of the layer's bounds rectangle. Animatable. \n> You specify the value for this property using the unit coordinate space. The default value of this property is (0.5, 0.5), which represents the center of the layer’s bounds rectangle. `All geometric manipulations to the view occur about the specified point`. For example, applying a rotation transform to a layer with the default anchor point causes the layer to rotate around its center. Changing the anchor point to a different location would cause the layer to rotate around that new point.                -- [Apple dev](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410817-anchorpoint)\n\nBy default, the anchor point for the rotation is the center of the view. That means the rotation of a view is based on its center. Inspired by this [article](https://commitocracy.com/implementing-foldview-in-react-native-e970011f98b8#.k95f793qe), which teaches us how to rotate a view based from the origin point, I got an important clue to implement the anchor point.  \n\n### Why do we need anchor point in react-native\n\n1. Currently, there is no public API in react-native providing the ability to set `transform-origin` or `anchor-point`. So you will find it is difficult to do some fancy 3D transform animations. For example, [cube animation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cube-transition) has some flaws: \n    - There is a gap between the views when translating views in Android \n    - The angle is not correct, less than 90 degrees, make the animation wired. It is not a cube, if you try to adjust the angle, you will break all the things. \n    - part of the view is clipped, not rendering on the screen. \n![image2020-5-27_17-17-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7471672/84166299-4c06dd00-aaa7-11ea-8c48-4e401c756767.png)\n\nActually, I use this function to solve all these issues. But it is code for company, I can't make it public. The key thing is to set anchor point as (1, 0.5) for the left view and (0, 0.5) for the right view. \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7471672/84166384-63de6100-aaa7-11ea-8102-9de5bee4cf18.png)\n\n2. Beside, for this foldview animation [foldview-in-react-native](https://commitocracy.com/implementing-foldview-in-react-native-e970011f98b8), one of the most import things is to use [`transformOrigin`](https://github.com/jmurzy/react-native-foldview/blob/892f89569cd851867602ce7412852515dccc7e5f/src/transformUtil.js#L3). But, this function works with `transform matrix`, and isn't easy to use. So, I made `react-native-anchor-point`. It looks simple and tricky, but actually very powerful. With it, you can use the transform API in react-native to achieve many fancy animations.\n\n\n### transformOrigin in react-native-foldview\n\n> “Since the transform origin of a view is at its horizontal and vertical center by default, to rotate it in x-space along the bottom, we need to first shift our view’s origin on the y-axis by 50% of the view’s height, then apply rotation, then shift it back to the original center.” — [@jmurzy](https://commitocracy.com/implementing-foldview-in-react-native-e970011f98b8)\n\nSo @jmurze implemented a [function]\n(https://gist.github.com/jmurzy/0d62c0b5ea88ca806c16b5e8a16deb6a#file-foldview-transformutil-transformorigin-js)\n\n```js\nfunction transformOrigin(matrix, origin) {\n  const { x, y, z } = origin;\n\n  const translate = MatrixMath.createIdentityMatrix();\n  MatrixMath.reuseTranslate3dCommand(translate, x, y, z);\n  MatrixMath.multiplyInto(matrix, translate, matrix);\n\n  const untranslate = MatrixMath.createIdentityMatrix();\n  MatrixMath.reuseTranslate3dCommand(untranslate, -x, -y, -z);\n  MatrixMath.multiplyInto(matrix, matrix, untranslate);\n}\n```\nHere\n-  `reuseTranslate3dCommand` in the [react-native source code](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/a1ac2518a364ebcd3cc024a22229cadc1791e1c4/Libraries/Utilities/MatrixMath.js#L95), is to replace the 12th, 13th, 14th element in the matrix by parameters, z, y, z to achieve `translation` effect. \n- `reuseTranslate3dCommand` is called in [processTransform.js#L79](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/a1ac2518a364ebcd3cc024a22229cadc1791e1c4/Libraries/StyleSheet/processTransform.js#L79), in which, RN generates a transform matrix based on `transform object` we provide. \n[https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/a1ac2518a364ebcd3cc024a22229cadc1791e1c4/Libraries/StyleSheet/processTransform.js#L43]\n\n### What `transformOrigin` does is to\n\n```\n1. translate the view by x, y, z on the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis \n2. apply rotation\n3. translate the view back by -x, -y, -z on the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis \n```\n\n\n### Plain Code\n\nAfter understanding the above things, we know we can can use `transform` style to set the anchor point. For example, the following code sets the anchor point of the view as (0, 0.5). This will make the rotate base on the left side of the view. \n\n```javascript\n   const transform = {\n      transform: [\n          {translateX: -w / 2}, \n          rotateY, \n          {translateX: w / 2}\n      ]\n    }\n    return (   \n        <Animated.View style={transform}></Animated.View>\n    )\n  }\n\n```\n![](./d32bef61.png)\n\nRemember that RN generates only one single transform matrix, based on `transform object` we provide, [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/a1ac2518a364ebcd3cc024a22229cadc1791e1c4/Libraries/StyleSheet/processTransform.js#L43). So, finally, the above code will be converted into a transform matrix, with which the rendering system can render a view with a given layout and shape.  There are some transform matrix knowledge involved. [ref: tutorial-3-matrices](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/)\n\n\n## react-native-anchor-point\n\nIn this [package](https://github.com/sueLan/react-native-anchor-point), I provides a function `withAnchorPoint`, to inject the above code into your `transform` object. It works well with the original way you use transform and. So, you don't have to use `ref` to set the `transformOrigin` any more. This would make the `3d transform` in React Native easier to implement. \n\n![](./rotateZ.gif)\n![](./rotateXY.gif)\n![](./rotate.gif)\n\nAnd it works well with the react-native `transform` API \n\n```\nimport { withAnchorPoint } from 'react-native-anchor-point';\n\ngetTransform = () => {\n    let transform = {\n        transform: [{ perspective: 400 }, { rotateX: rotateValue }],\n    };\n    // inject the anchor point here\n    return withAnchorPoint(transform, { x: 0.5, y: 0 }, { width: CARD_WIDTH, height: CARD_HEIGHT });\n};\n    \n<Animated.View style={[styles.blockBlue, this.getTransform()]} />\n```\n\n## Ref\n\n- [Matrices](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/)\n- [react-native-foldview](https://github.com/jmurzy/react-native-foldview)\n- [RN How to set the anchor point of a view.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60632809/4026902)\n- https://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/geometry/geo-tran.html\n","tags":["Animation"],"categories":["React Native"]},{"title":"Work with Wider Color","url":"/2020/05/09/20190509-Work-with-Wider-Color/","content":"\n\n# Work with Wider Color \nhttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/712\n\n## Basic concepts about color\n\n### What is Color Space \n\n> A color space is a specific organization of colors. In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations.            --- Wiki\n\n![](media/15884935782947/15884941050187.jpg)\n\nThis is the standard RGB space, which is the default color space in iOS. \n\n#### Color Primaries\n> Color primaries generally fall at the most intense value that you can get with that particular color channel.\n\nLike, in sRGB space, the color primaries are \n> RGB {0.0, 0.0, 0.0} = Black \nRGB {1.0, 1.0, 1.0} = White \nRGB {1.0, 0.0, 0.0} = Red\n\n#### Color gamut \n  All of the colors that can be defined as a combination of those individual color channels. \n\n\n## Display P3 \n\n\n![](media/15884935782947/15885097554778.jpg)\n\nIn the above image, the colored region represents the outer limits of perception in a human's color vision. \n\nThe inner black triangle represents sRGB's limits of presentation.\nIn contrast, the DCI-P3 standard, and the Wide Color implementation, has a larger area underneath the triangle, representing the greater array of displayable color possible.\n\n- 16bit per color channel for P3 and beyond \n\n### Extended Range sRGB \n\n- Display P3\n    - {1.0, 0.0, 0.0}\n- Extended Range sRGB\n    - {1.358, -0.074, -0.012}\n## Wider Color \n                        \n                        \n> Wide color displays support a P3 color space, which can produce richer, more saturated colors than sRGB. As a result, photos and videos that use wide color are more lifelike, and visual data and status indicators that use wide color are more impactful.\n\n\n## Color Management \n\nApplication Content Types\n- Static image resources\n- Document and network image resources\n- Advanced Media\n- GPU Textures\n\nFraming the Color Problem\n- App Content can come in a broad range of color richness from many sources Devices and \n- Displays come in a broad range of color capabilities\n\n### How do we bridge the differences?\n\nThe answer is color management. \n\n> The job of color management is to ensure that an image looks the same on any output device no matter what color space it is encoded in.\n\n### How does it work?\n\n- Every image has an associated color space (color profile)\n- Color matching maps image colors to output device\n    - ![](media/15884935782947/15885122964828.jpg)\n\n- Not for free: Every pixel needs to be color matched\n- Potentially lossy: Color fidelity is lost when output has smaller gamut. For example, going down from P3 color space to sRGB color space. \n\nOpti in System: \n\n- Color matching operations are easily hardware accelerated\n\n- Color matching operations are easily hardware accelerated\n- Properly tagged content requires no code to display properly\n\n## Design Considerations for Wide Gamut \n\n- Use wide gamut content where it makes sense\n- Use where vivid colors enhance the user experience\n- No need to change all content to P3\n- Toolchain support makes gradual opt-in of wide gamut content possible\n\n## Upgrading Content to Wide Color\n\nBe careful when promoting an existing design file to wide color! \n- Don’t “assign” P3 profile. It just remaps the existing color information into new color space.

It doesn't support wider color. \n\n> The format for the bitmap is a ARGB 32-bit\n>  integer pixel format using host-byte order\n\n`UIGraphicsBeginImageContext` not only cannot create contexts with more than 8 bits per color channel, but also cannot represent colors in extended range sRGB. Sadlly, existing interface has no ability to create a context in non-sRGB color space. \n\nSo, they introduce `UIGraphicsImageRenderer(size: CGSize)` \n\n```swift \n\nlet renderer = UIGraphicsImageRenderer(size: CGSize(width: 250, height: 250))\nlet image =  renderer.image { rendererContext in\n    let bounds = rendererContext.format.bounds\n    let rects = bounds.divided(atDistance: bounds.size.width/2, from: .minXEdge)\n    \n    UIColor(displayP3Red: 1.0, green: 0.0, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0).set()\n    rendererContext.fill(rects.slice)\n    \n    UIColor(red: 1.0, green: 0.0, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0).set()\n    rendererContext.fill(rects.slice)\n}\n```\n\n- Fully color managed by default\n- Supports extended range sRGB color space\n- Manages CGContext lifetime\n\n\n### Draw \n\n`UIView`, `UIImageView`, Color managed since iOS 9.3 \n```swift \ndraw(_ rect: CGRect) // called in the extended sRGB color space\n```\n\nFor `UIView`, use the view’s layer’s `contentsFormat` property\n\nValid CALayer contents formats:\n- kCAContentsFormatRGBA8Uint\n- kCAContentsFormatRGBA16Float\n- kCAContentsFormatGray8Uint","tags":["WWDC","Image"]},{"title":"iOS images in memory","url":"/2020/05/03/iOS-images-in-memory/","content":"\n> Notes for [wwdc2018/219](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/219) and [wwdc2018/416](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/416/)\n\n## Why memory and CPU matter? \n![](media/15884695669510/15888626848016.jpg)\n\n\n- It is obvious that too much usage of `CPU` has negative impact on `battery life` and `responsiveness`.  \n- But, if you application consumes too much memory, that causes more `CPU utilization`, which have negative effects on `battery life` and `performance`.\n\n## Basic Concepts \n\n### Buffers \n> Buffer is contiguous region of memory. \nIt is often viewed as sequence of elements of the same sizes, usually of the same internal construction. \n\n![-w354](media/15884695669510/15888596565806.jpg)\n\n\n\n#### Image Buffers \n\n> One kind of the important buffers is the `Image Buffer`, which holds the `in-memory representation of some image`. \n\nEach element in image buffers describes the color and the transparency of single pixel in our image. Constantly, the buffer size is proportional to image size. For example, in the image with sRBG format, each 32 bits describes the color and transparency of a single pixel. `The buffer size =  4 byte  x image_width x image_height`\n\n\n\n![-w452](media/15884695669510/15888600604360.jpg)\n\n#### Frame buffer \n\n> The frame buffer is what holds the actual rendered output of your application.  \n\nAs your application updates its view hierarchy UIKit will render the application's `window` and all of its `subviews` into the `frame buffer`. And that frame buffer provides per pixel color information that the `display hardware` will read in order to illuminate the pixels on the display.\n\n[Related resource: The View Drawing Cycle](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewPG_iPhoneOS/WindowsandViews/WindowsandViews.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009503-CH2-SW10)\n\nThe pipeline is like this: \n\n![](image_graphic.gif)\n\n#### Data Buffer\n\n> a data buffer is just a buffer that contains a sequence of bytes. \n\nIf we've downloaded images from the network or we've `loaded` them from disk. A data buffer that contains an image file, typically, begins with some metadata describing the size of the image that's stored in that data buffer.\n\n![-w397](media/15884695669510/15888655020412.jpg)\n\n- Store contents of an `image file` in memory. The `size` is the same as that in the image file in the disk. \n- Metadata describing dimensions of image\n- Image itself `encoded` as JPEG, PNG, or other (usually compressed) form\n- Bytes `do not `directly describe pixels\n\n\n### The Pipeline in Action \n\n![-w834](media/15884695669510/15890026431784.jpg)\n\n\n## Consequences of Excessive Memory Usage \n\n- Increased fragmentation. \n    - `fragment` : The large allocation that is in your application's address space could force other related content apart from content that it wants to reference.\n- Poor locality of reference\n- System starts `compressing` memory Process termination\n    - Eventually, if your application starts accumulating a lot of memory usage the operating system will step in and start transparently `compressing` the content of physical memory. Now, the CPU needs to be involved in this operation so in addition to any CPU usage in your own application. You could be `increasing global CPU usage` that you have no control over. Eventually, your application could start consuming so much physical memory that the OS needs to start `terminating processes`. And it'll start with background processes of low priority.\n\n- You app may be terminated by the system\n- Cause `CPU peak`, and then has negative impact on battery life and responsiveness.\n\n## Decoding \n\n> Decoding is an operation that will convert the JPEG or PNG or other encoded image data into per pixel image information. \n\n- CPU-intensive process\n\n- The memory used for the image buffer is proportional to original image size, not view size. \n- There are persistent large memory allocation in decoding.\n- The image buffer is retained for repeat rendering by UIImage. \n\nAfter decoding, UIImage will hang onto that image buffer, so that it only does that work once. Consequently, your application, for every image that gets decoded, could have a persistent and large memory allocation hanging out.\n\n## The memory use of an image using sRGB space\n\n> Memory use is related to the dimensions of the images, not the file size.\n\nTake the following image as an instance, its file size is 590KB, with dimension 2048 x 1536 pixel.\n![83dca9cf.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/83dca9cf.png)\n\n\n### 4 byetes for each pixel in RGBA \n\nBy this [article](https://www.objc.io/issues/3-views/moving-pixels-onto-the-screen/), each pixel in sRGB image needs 32bit, 4 bytes, in memory when it's decoded. Because in sRGB, there are Red, Green, Blue 3 channels and Alpha. The range of each channel value is from 0 to 255, which needs 8 bits to represent the value. \n\n```\n  A   R   G   B   A   R   G   B   A   R   G   B  \n | pixel 0       | pixel 1       | pixel 2   \n  0  233  2  100  4  155 255  7   8   9   10  11 \n```\n  \n\n### More memory usage when decoding a image \n\nA image have load -> decode -> render these 3 phases.  \n\n![64aaa3cd.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/ed4e1c96.png)\n\n\n\nWe only need 590KB to load a image, while we need \n`2048 pixels x 1536 pixels x 4 bytes per pixel` = 10MB when decoding \n  \n\n\n##  Image Rendering Pipeline \n\n- `UIImage` is responsible for loading image content. Usually, it is bigger than the ImageView that is going to display it. \n- `UIImageView` is responsible for displaying the image. The image which it is going to display will be shrink down to fit its size. \n ![](media/15884695669510/15889026761062.jpg)\n\n\n## Downsampling\nSo, we can use technique, called Downsampling, to `downsample` the images to `the size that they're going to be displayed`. Rather than having these large allocations hanging around, we're reducing our memory usage.\n\n![-w1333](media/15884695669510/15889088392417.jpg)\n\n```swift \n// Downsampling large images for display at smaller size\nfunc downsample(imageAt imageURL: URL, to pointSize: CGSize, scale: CGFloat) -> UIImage {\n    // ShouldCache flag tells Core Graphics framework that we're just creating an object to\n    // represent the infomation stored in the file at this URL\n    let imageSourceOptions = [kCGImageSourceShouldCache: false] as CFDictionary\n    let imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(imageURL as CFURL, imageSourceOptions)!\n    let maxDimensionInPixels = max(pointSize.width, pointSize.height) * scale\n    let downsampleOptions =\n        // Ask the Core Graphics to create the decoded image buffer for me when calling it to create the thumbnail\n        [kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,\n        kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately: true,\n        // Should include kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true in the options dictionary. Otherwise, the image result will appear rotated when an image is taken from camera in the portrait orientation.\n        kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true,\n        kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: maxDimensionInPixels] as CFDictionary\n    let downsampledImage =\n        CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(imageSource, 0, downsampleOptions)!\n    return UIImage(cgImage: downsampledImage)\n}\n```\n\n## Decoding in ScrollViews \n### The cause of the ScrollView hitch \n\n![-w1178](media/15884695669510/15889147842616.jpg)\n\n\n> When beginning scrolling, we're about to display another row of images. And we're about to ask Core Graphics to `decode` those images before we hand the cells back to UICollectionView.\nAnd that could take `a lot of CPU time`. So much so, that we `don't` get around to `re-rendering the frame buffer`. But the `display hardware` is operating on a `fixed interval`. So, from the user's perspective the application has just `stuttered`. Now, we're done decoding these images, we're able to provide those cells back to UICollectionView. And animation continues on, as before. Just saw a `visual hitch`, \n\n## Two techniques to smooth out CPU usage \n\n1. prefetching \n2. performing work in the background\n\n### Thread Explosion \nIt is caused by \n- More images to decode than available CPUs \n- GCD continues creating threads as new work is enqueued\n- Each thread gets less time to actually decode images\n\n\n> Now, to avoid deadlock when we dispatch asynchronously to a global queue, GCD is going to create new threads to capture the work we're asking it to do. And then, the CPUs are going to spend a lot of time moving between those threads to try and make incremental progress on all of the work we asked the operating system to do for us. And switching between those threads, actually, has a pretty significant overhead.\n\n\nwe're going to serialize some work.\n\nSo, rather than simply dispatching work to one of the global asynchronous queues, we're going to create a serial queue. And inside of our implementation of the prefetch method we're going to asynchronously dispatch to that queue.\n\n![-w1516](media/15884695669510/15889150745604.jpg)\n\n## Image Sources \n\nImages may come from \n- Image assets in asset catalog\n- Files in application/framework bundle\n- Files in Documents and Caches directories \n- Data downloaded from network\n\nThis session suggests us to use image assets for the following reasons: \n\n- Optimized name- and trait-based lookup\n   - It's `faster` to `look up` an image asset in the asset catalog, than it is to search for files on disk that have a certain naming scheme. \n\n- Smarter buffer caching\n    - The asset catalog runtime has, also, got some really good smarts in it for managing `buffer sizes`.\n\n- Per-device thinning\n   - your application only downloads image resources that are relevant to the device that it's going to run on and vector artwork. The \n\n- Vector artwork\n\n## Vector artwork\n\n- Since iOS 11, image assets support  “Preserve Vector Data”\n- Avoids blurriness and aliasing when drawn larger or smaller than natural size\n\n\n\n## Image Rendering Format \n\n### SRGB\n- 4 bytes per pixel \n- full color images \n- most common used \n![a1bf604b.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/a1bf604b.png)\n\n### Wide format \n\n- 8 bytes per pixel \n- super accurate colors. Because they use 8bytes, 16 bits, for each channel. In the meantime, double the image size.  \n- Only useful with wide color display. We don't want to use it when we don't need to. \n- Wide color capture cameras since iPhone 7\n  \n\n![75a1a01e.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/75a1a01e.png)\n\n### Luminance and alpha 8 format\n\nThis image only holds grayscale value. And the image size is smaller. \n\n- 2 bytes per pixel \n- Single-color iamges and alpha\n- Most used in Metal shaders, not very common. \n![6383b177.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/6383b177.png)\n### Alpha 8 Format \n\n- 1 byte per pixel \n- Userful for monochrome images because it uses less memory. \n  - masks \n  - Emoji-free text \n- 75% smaller than SRGB\n\n![753920b5.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/753920b5.png)\nWe can also change `image.tintColor` in this image without changing its format.  \n\n## How do I pick the right format?\n\n`UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions` always uses SRGB rendering-format, which use 4 bytes per pixel. \n\nwhile `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`, which introduced in iOS 10 will automatically pick the best graphic format in iOS12. It means, you will save 75% of memory by replacing `UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions` with  `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`\n\n\n**Do** ✅\n\n![2f0229d3.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/2f0229d3.png)\n## Use ImageIO to downsample images\n\n`UIImage` is expensive for sizing and to resizing\n- Will decompress original image into memory \n- Internal coordinate space transforms are expensive\n\n**Don't** ❌\n\n \n![c25d45de.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/c25d45de.png)\n\nUse ImageIO\n- ImageIO can read image sizes and metadata information without dirtying memory.\n\n- ImageIO can resize images at cost of resized image only.\n\n**Do** ✅\n![922ac245.png](28bfb5ac-c3fa-4575-a1b1-72fcbacc9069/922ac245.png)\n\nThe bad is that you have to specify some options. \n\n## Resize image effectively\n\nThis is a function of resizing image without reading it into the memory, using ImageIO.  \n\n```swift\nfunc resize(url: NSURL, maxPixelSize: Int) -> CGImage? {\n    let imgSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url, nil)\n    guard let imageSource = imgSource else {\n        return nil\n    }\n\n    var scaledImage: CGImage?\n    let options: [NSString: Any] = [\n            // The maximum width and height in pixels of a thumbnail.\n            kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: maxPixelSize,\n            kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,\n            // Should include kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true in the options dictionary.

[iOS Memory Deep Dive - WWDC 2018 - Videos - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/416/). I saw it and took some notes here. \n\n> Not all memory is created equal. \n\nThere are dirty memory, clean memory, compressed memory in iOS system. We have to know the differences between them. \n\n## Page  \n\nPage is typically 16KB in size and operating system gives it to you when your app requests memory.  \n\n```\nmemory in use = number of pages x page size \n```\n\n![b576f28d.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/b576f28d.png)\n\nSome pages can hold multiple objects, and some objects\ncan span multiple pages. \n\n\n\n### Pages Types \n  - Clean\n    - Data that can be paged out of memory\n    - Memory mapped files\n    - frameworks*\n     \n  - Dirty \n    - memory written by an app \n    - all heap allocations\n    - decoded image buffers\n  - Comporessed \n\n> There is no traditional disk swap in iOS \n\n\n## Memory compressor \n\nThe system will do the compression and decompression for you by memory compressor.\n\nWhat does Memory compressor do? \n\n- Compresses unaccessed pages \n- Decompresses pages upon access\n\n\nBefore being compressed: \n\n\n![cdb635fb.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/cdb635fb.png)\n\nAfter being compressed: \n![8b7d45fa.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/8b7d45fa.png)\n\n\nWhen you got Memory warning, you App is not always the cause. Maybe because the compressor freeing memory. Like, you receiving a phone call while using the App.\n\nAfter being decompressed: \n\n![f0910e00.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/f0910e00.png)\n\nAfter removing objects in `didReceiveMemoryWarning` \n\n\n![28bedf77.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/28bedf77.png)\n\n## Caching \n\n- Trade-offs between CPU and memory. Caching can reduce the CPU usage and time complexity, but it costs memory. \n- Remember the compressor. When decompressing, the used memory will be increased.\n- Prefer NSCache over dictionary. \n\n\n## Memory Profile \n\nIt is the dirty size + the compressed size that the system uses to determine how much memory the app is really using. \n\nWe should mainly focuse on these two part, dirty and compressed memory when analyzing the memory profile.  \n![8af52c4f.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/8af52c4f.png)\n\n\n\n## Tools for Profiling Footprint \n\n1.

So we should care more about `dirty size` and `swapped size`.\n\n#### An example of using vmmap to debug a memory issue\n\nFirst, we can use summary info to look for the big numbers in `virtual size` and `swapped size` colomn. Here, we find `CG Image` takes much more memory than others. \n\n\n```\nvmmap --summary PlanetPics.memgraph\n```\n![d58088d1.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/d58088d1.png)\n\n\nThen, we use `grep` to get more info about `CG Image`. \n![751c8f78.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/751c8f78.png)\n\nThere are  two regions here, the last row is summary info. The secong CG Image region takes more takes more dirty and swapped memory. So we have to see more infomation of this region by using `--verbose` option.\n\nAll these commands can work with other shell commands, like redirecting the output stream a `output.txt` file. \n\n\n```\nvmmap --verbose PlanetPics.memgraph | grep \" CG image\" | > output.txt\n```\n![14c0b2ff.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/14c0b2ff.png)\n\n\n\nAnd we will more regions.   \n\n> It turns out that vmmap, by default, if it finds contiguous regions, it collapses. A general rule. the later region was created, the later my app's life cycle it happened. Chance are this later region is more closely tied to whatever caused that memory pike. \n\nSo, we start to look at the last region. We can use the start memory address of the last region and search it in the memory graph in XCode.\n\n![5d389834.png](f30bdfea-25ac-4eb9-af3e-278a74a85022/5d389834.png)\n\nOr use `leak` to get the trace tree.

And there is an embedded network plugin, `FlipperKitNetworkPlugin` ,  which works as an inspector of network activities in our application. Let's figure out how it can achieve that. \n\n## Overview \n\nHere comes the class diagram of this network plugin. \n\n![class](class.png)\n\nIn these classes, `FLEXNetworkObserver` is the key one for this plugin. \n\nWhen the plugin starts, it will inject all the `NSURLConnectionDelegate` classes and functions to observe the remote request and response event. \n\n## Swizzle \n\nThe key idea is to swizzle any classes that implement one of the selectors in `URLSession` and `NSURLConnectionDelegate` , and get chance to get the request and response data. \n\nThe process is like this: \n\n1. find out selectors in `URLSession` and `NSURLConnectionDelegate`  which are related to network activities. \n2. Retrieve all the class definitions that have been registered with the Objective-C runtime. The Objective-C runtime library automatically registers all the classes defined in your source code. \n3. Find any class that implements one of the above selectors\n4. Inject this class\n    \n\n\n```objective-c\n+ (void)injectIntoAllNSURLConnectionDelegateClasses {\n  // Only allow swizzling once.\n  static dispatch_once_t onceToken;\n  dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{\n    // 1. 🌟 Swizzle any classes that implement one of these selectors.  \n   const SEL selectors[] = {\n      @selector(connectionDidFinishLoading:),\n      @selector(connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:),\n      @selector(connection:didReceiveResponse:),\n      @selector(connection:didReceiveData:),\n      @selector(connection:didFailWithError:),\n      @selector\n      (URLSession:\n             task:willPerformHTTPRedirection:newRequest:completionHandler:),\n      @selector(URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData:),\n      @selector(URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveResponse:completionHandler:),\n      @selector(URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError:),\n      @selector(URLSession:dataTask:didBecomeDownloadTask:),\n      @selector(URLSession:\n              downloadTask:didWriteData:totalBytesWritten\n                          :totalBytesExpectedToWrite:),\n      @selector(URLSession:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingToURL:)\n    };\n\n    const int numSelectors = sizeof(selectors) / sizeof(SEL);\n\n    // 2. 🌟 Retrieve all the class definitions that have been registered with the Objective-C runtime.

That's\n        // why we iterate through the method list.\n        unsigned int methodCount = 0;\n        Method* methods = class_copyMethodList(className, &methodCount);\n        BOOL matchingSelectorFound = NO;\n        for (unsigned int methodIndex = 0; methodIndex < methodCount;\n             methodIndex++) {\n          for (int selectorIndex = 0; selectorIndex < numSelectors;\n               ++selectorIndex) {\n            // Find a target method in this class \n            if (method_getName(methods[methodIndex]) ==\n                selectors[selectorIndex]) {\n              // 4. 🌟 Inject this class  \n              [self injectIntoDelegateClass:className];\n              matchingSelectorFound = YES;\n              break;\n            }\n          }\n          if (matchingSelectorFound) {\n            break;\n          }\n        }\n        free(methods);\n      }\n\n      free(classes);\n    }\n\n    [self injectIntoNSURLConnectionCancel];\n    [self injectIntoNSURLSessionTaskResume];\n\n    [self injectIntoNSURLConnectionAsynchronousClassMethod];\n    [self injectIntoNSURLConnectionSynchronousClassMethod];\n\n    [self injectIntoNSURLSessionAsyncDataAndDownloadTaskMethods];\n    [self injectIntoNSURLSessionAsyncUploadTaskMethods];\n  });\n}\n```\n\nFor example, how to inject `connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:`?\n\n```objective-c \n\n+ (void)injectWillSendRequestIntoDelegateClass:(Class)cls {\n  SEL selector = \n  @selector(connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:);\n  //  🌟 Selector with `_flex_swizzle_` prefix\n  SEL swizzledSelector = [FLEXUtility swizzledSelectorForSelector:selector];\n\n  Protocol* protocol = @protocol(NSURLConnectionDataDelegate);\n  if (!protocol) {\n    protocol = @protocol(NSURLConnectionDelegate);\n  }\n  // 🌟 Get the original method description\n  struct objc_method_description methodDescription =\n      protocol_getMethodDescription(protocol, selector, NO, YES);\n\n  typedef NSURLRequest* (^NSURLConnectionWillSendRequestBlock)(\n      id<NSURLConnectionDelegate> slf,\n      NSURLConnection* connection,\n      NSURLRequest* request,\n      NSURLResponse* response);\n\n  // 🌟 If selector `connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:` is not a instance method in this class, use this block as the implementation for swizzledSelector\n  NSURLConnectionWillSendRequestBlock undefinedBlock = ^NSURLRequest*(\n      id<NSURLConnectionDelegate> slf,\n      NSURLConnection* connection,\n      NSURLRequest* request,\n      NSURLResponse* response) {\n    [[FLEXNetworkObserver sharedObserver] connection:connection\n                                     willSendRequest:request\n                                    redirectResponse:response\n                                            delegate:slf];\n    return request;\n  };\n\n  // The implementation for swizzledSelector\n  NSURLConnectionWillSendRequestBlock implementationBlock = ^NSURLRequest*(\n      id<NSURLConnectionDelegate> slf,\n      NSURLConnection* connection,\n      NSURLRequest* request,\n      NSURLResponse* response) {\n    __block NSURLRequest* returnValue = nil;\n    [self sniffWithoutDuplicationForObject:connection\n        selector:selector\n        sniffingBlock:^{\n          undefinedBlock(slf, connection, request, response);\n        }\n        originalImplementationBlock:^{\n          returnValue = ((id(*)(id, SEL, id, id, id))objc_msgSend)(\n              slf, swizzledSelector, connection, request, response);\n        }];\n    return returnValue;\n  };\n  // Swizzle; \n[FLEXUtility replaceImplementationOfSelector:selector\n                                  withSelector:swizzledSelector\n                                      forClass:cls\n                         withMethodDescription:methodDescription\n                           implementationBlock:implementationBlock\n                                undefinedBlock:undefinedBlock];\n}\n```\n\nThen, replace the original implementation of `connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:` method with flipper's own implementation for `swizzledSelector`. \n\n```objective-c \n\n+ (void)replaceImplementationOfSelector:(SEL)selector\n                           withSelector:(SEL)swizzledSelector\n                               forClass:(Class)cls\n                  withMethodDescription:\n                      (struct objc_method_description)methodDescription\n                    implementationBlock:(id)implementationBlock\n                         undefinedBlock:(id)undefinedBlock {\n  if ([self instanceRespondsButDoesNotImplementSelector:selector class:cls]) {\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  // The implementation for swizzledSelector\n  IMP implementation = imp_implementationWithBlock((id)(\n      [cls instancesRespondToSelector:selector] ?

In fact, its original implementations have been replaced. And Flipper's own implementations for these two selector are called, which call the related `willSendRequest:` and `didReceiveResponse:` method in `FLEXNetworkObserver` class.  So, Flipper got the chance to observe the request and response of network activities. \n\n![a](activity_network.png)\n\n\n","tags":["Debug","Flipper"],"categories":["iOS","Network"]},{"title":"iOS Simulator from the Command Line","url":"/2020/02/05/iOS-Simulator-from-the-Command-Line/","content":"\n`xcrun simctl` is command utils to control iOS simulator, just like  [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb?hl=en) for Android.

We can get a list of device types, a list of info of runtime names, a list of device names. \n  \n```\n== Device Types ==\niPhone 11 Pro (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-11-Pro)\niPhone 11 Pro Max (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iP\n\n== Runtimes ==\niOS 13.3 (13.3 - 17C45) - com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-3 \n\n== Devices ==\n-- iOS 13.3 --\niPhone 11 Pro Max (34C9AC6A-577D-4CEF-8B10-20011DCFBA27) (Shutdown) \n```\n\nUse `xcrun simctl list device` to see the list of device info. Or use a device name to get paired devices' info, like name, uuid, and status. For example,  \n\n```\nxcrun simctl list devices \"iPhone 11 Pro Max\"\n```\n\n```\n== Devices ==\n-- iOS 12.4 --\n-- iOS 13.3 --\n    iPhone 11 Pro Max (34C9AC6A-577D-4CEF-8B10-20011DCFBA27) (Shutdown) \n-- tvOS 13.3 --\n-- watchOS 6.1 --\n-- Unavailale: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-0 --\n    iPhone 11 Pro Max (893827B6-91E0-417C-A179-68343F695040) (Creating) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)\n-- Unavailable: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-1 --\n    iPhone 11 Pro Max (F4B573E0-4106-4FF2-ADA8-16DCC053026C) (Shutdown) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)\n-- Unavailable: com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-2 --\n    iPhone 11 Pro Max (B63C96BD-1CE2-499B-8387-3B8AEBF50931) (Creating) (unavailable, runtime profile not found)\n```\n\n### Get device environment variable \n\n`xcrun simctl getenv` is for printing an environment variable from a running device. \n\n```\nUsage: simctl getenv <device> <variable name>\n```\n\n\nTake the follow command as an example, the `SIMULATOR_UDID` environment variable contains the UDID of the simulated device. But it doesn't work for physical device. \n\n```\nxcrun simctl getenv booted SIMULATOR_UDID\n9362BF90-132F-4894-A057-CEBFEC9C1FB6\n```\n\nWe can add more environment variables by ourselves in schema for debugging use. \n![](environment_variable.png)\n\n[Launch Arguments & Environment Variables](https://nshipster.com/launch-arguments-and-environment-variables/)\n\n### Create a custom simulator\n\n\n`xcrun simctl create <name> <device type> <runtime>`\nFor example, if I would like to create a iPhone 11 Pro Max with iOS 13.3, I can use the follow command.\n\n```\nxcrun simctl create \"ry\" \"iPhone 11 Pro Max\" iOS13.3  \nBE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5 \n```\n\n\n\nThe `uuid` of the new simulator is `BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5`, which is output in standard out. And errors comes to standard error. \n\n> Tips: you should use available runtime, or you will get an error of `invalid runtime: xxx`. \n\nIf in shell scrip, we can capture the new device's name using environment variable:\n\n```\nNEW_DEVICE=$(xcrun simctl create \"Test Phone\" \"iPhone XR\" iOS13.0)\necho \"🤖 Created ${NEW_DEVICE}\"\n🤖 Created BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5\n```\n\nAnother way to create a simulator using GUI is to go to `Window` -> `Devices and Simulators` \n\n![create](create.png)\n   \n### Boot a simulator \n\nBoot a device using `$uuid` \n\n`xcrun simctl boot BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5` \n\nUse `simctl shutdown <device>` to shutdown a device. \n\n### Install/Uninstall app \n\n`xcrun simctl install <device> <path>`. We use this command to install an app on a device. \n\n```\n➜  xcrun simctl install booted ./demo.app\n```\n\n `booted` is the alias name of the booted device. We can also use `uuid` of a device.\n\n use ` simctl uninstall <device> <app bundle identifier>` to uninstall an app. like \n `xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo`  \n\n### Launch \n\n`xcrun simctl launch <device> <bundle> <arguments>`. \n\nLaunch command is used to launch a application in your simulator device.\n\n```\nxcrun simctl launch booted com.apple.example -MyDefaultKey YES\n```\n\n`com.apple.example` is bundle id of the application. \n\nIf we use `--console-pty`,  launch command will connect the standard output and error of the application to the terminal line.\n\n```\n➜  xcrun simctl launch --console-pty booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo\n\ncom.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo: 98045\n2020-02-09 10:38:28.594 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] gesture end translation x -281.000000; velocity-1056.111584\n2020-02-09 10:38:28.594 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -281.000332\n2020-02-09 10:38:28.611 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -285.030635\n2020-02-09 10:38:28.627 3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo[98045:931065] timer current tx -289.060938\n```\n\n\n Use `xcrun simctl terminate <device> <bundle>` to terminate an application by identifier on a device.\n### Container Path \n\n`xcrun simctl simctl get_app_container <device> <app bundle identifier> [<container>]`  command is used to get the path of the installed app's container.  \n\n```\ncontainer   Optionally specify the container. Defaults to app.\n  app                 The .app bundle\n  data                The application's data container\n  groups              The App Group containers\n  <group identifier>  A specific App Group container\n```\n\n\nFor example\n\n```\n➜ xcrun simctl get_app_container booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo \n~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5/data/Containers/Bundle/Application/135A7B46-DE38-47EC-9871-D1F3615E9CE5/3DCubeTransitionAnimationDemo.app\n➜ xcrun simctl get_app_container booted com.rong.lan.CubeTransitionAnimationDemo data \n~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5/data/Containers/Data/Application/10D64231-20B5-4DFE-B1E9-277AD9C02C4F\n```\n\n### Spawn \n\nSpawn command will pause xspawn, a process inside the simulator environment. \n\n```\nxcrun simctl spawn booted defaults write com.example.app ResetDatabase -bool YES\n```\nHere, we use `defaults` utils, because we already have a booted device `BE9A72F0-5793-447B-BEC4-63A73242BED5`, we don't have to specify the device. \n\n`com.example.app` is bundle id of my application. We reset `ResetDatabase` to YES. \nThis is a handy way to change the user defaults for the application before its running.  \n\n### Log Stream \n\nspwan command would work with log stream utility. We can pass a predicate and filter the log output. Here the predicate is `senderImagePath CONTAINS \"nsurlsessiond\"`. We can debug something wrong with URL session. \n\n```\nxcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'senderImagePath CONTAINS \"nsurlsessiond\"'\n```\n![spwan](spawn_log.png)\n\nAlso, we can use different predicates to filter what we want.  \n\n```\nxcrun simctl spawn booted log stream — predicate ‘processImagePath endswith “xxx”’\nxcrun simctl spawn booted log stream — predicate ‘eventMessage contains “error” and messageType == info’\n\n```\n\n\n### Dignose \n\nIn a auto-test system, if having some kind of issue, by using this command, you can not only collect logs on disk but also capture ephemeral logging and dump system state. \n\n```\n➜  xcrun simctl diagnose -l                              \nWriting to /private/tmp/simctl_diagnose_2020_02_09.10-10-56+0800\nGetting Simulator component versions...\nCollecting CoreSimulator logs...\nCollecting device information (this may take some time)...\nThis operation will time-out after 300 seconds.\nGathering 15 crash reports...\nCompressing Archive...\nSuccessfully wrote simctl diagnose archive to '/private/tmp/simctl_diagnose_2020_02_09.10-10-56+0800.tar.gz'\n```\n\n![diagnose](diagnose.png)\n\n### Clone \nClone is a very powerful command. See details in [wwdc2019/418](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/418/).  \n\n`xcrun simctl clone <device> <clone name>`.  You can copy your custom device using this command. \n\n```\n// boot base simulator ry\n➜ xcrun simctl boot ry   \n➜ xcrun simctl install ry ./demo.app\n// Must shutdown it before clone \n➜ xcrun simctl shutdown all \n➜ xcrun simctl clone ry ry-1  \n➜ xcrun simctl clone ry ry-2 \n➜ xcrun simctl boot ry-1 && xcrun simctl boot ry-2 \n```\n\n\nTwo new devices are created with the same contents. \n\n![clone](clone.png)\n\n\n### Push Notification to simulator \n\n1. Create a `.apns` file, `ExamplePush.apns` \n\n```\n{\n    \"Simulator Target Bundle\": \"com.facebook.flipper\",\n    \"aps\": {\n        \"alert\": \"This is a simulated notification!\",\n        \"badge\": 3,\n        \"sound\": \"default\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n[valid Apple Push Notification values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification)\n\n2.

When we scroll a FlatList, the items showed on the screen change. This function is called telling what current `viewableItems` are and what `changed` items are. \n\nThis function should be used together with [viewabilityConfig](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/virtualizedlist#viewabilityconfig). A specific `onViewableItemsChanged` will be called when its corresponding `ViewabilityConfig`'s conditions are met.\n\nHere is [ViewabilityConfig](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist#viewabilityconfig) \n```js \nexport type ViewabilityConfig = {\n  /**\n   * Minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) that an item must be physically viewable before the\n   * viewability callback will be fired. A high number means that scrolling through content without\n   * stopping will not mark the content as viewable.\n   */\n  minimumViewTime?: number,\n\n  /**\n   * Percent of viewport that must be covered for a partially occluded item to count as\n   * \"viewable\", 0-100. Fully visible items are always considered viewable. A value of 0 means\n   * that a single pixel in the viewport makes the item viewable, and a value of 100 means that\n   * an item must be either entirely visible or cover the entire viewport to count as viewable.\n   */\n  viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold?: number,\n\n  /**\n   * Similar to `viewAreaPercentThreshold`, but considers the percent of the item that is visible,\n   * rather than the fraction of the viewable area it covers.\n   */\n  itemVisiblePercentThreshold?: number,\n\n  /**\n   * Nothing is considered viewable until the user scrolls or `recordInteraction` is called after\n   * render.\n   */\n  waitForInteraction?: boolean,\n|};\n```\nHere is the type of `onViewableItemsChanged`: \n```js\n /**\n   * Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the\n   * `viewabilityConfig` prop.\n   */\n  onViewableItemsChanged?: ?(info: {\n    viewableItems: Array<ViewToken>,\n    changed: Array<ViewToken>,\n    ...\n  }) => void,\n  \nexport type ViewToken = {\n  item: any,\n  // The key of this item\n  key: string,\n  index: ?number,\n  // indicated whether this item is viewable or not\n  isViewable: boolean,\n  section?: any,\n  ...\n};\n```\n## How to use it \n\n```js\n  viewabilityConfig = {\n    waitForInteraction: true,\n    viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold: 95,\n    itemVisiblePercentThreshold: 75\n  }\n\n  onViewableItemsChanged = ({viewableItems, changed}) => {\n    console.log(\"Visible items are\", viewableItems);\n    console.log(\"Changed in this iteration\", changed);\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <FlatList\n        style={{\n          paddingTop: 60\n        }}\n        viewabilityConfig={this.viewabilityConfig}\n        onViewableItemsChanged={this.onViewableItemsChanged}\n        data={this._items}\n        renderItem={this._renderItem}\n        keyExtractor={item => item.id}\n      />\n    )\n  }\n```\n\n## The Implementation \n\n### 1. Overview \n\n\n![a0336b02.png](/img/9af4f3b0-fe64-4a98-b94e-d456f65ae7cc/a0336b02.png)\n\n### 2. The Viewable Region \n\n1. Get VirtualizedList layout info from the `nativeEvent` using the `onScroll` func, and store these info in `scrollMetrics` object. \n\n\n```js\nconst timestamp = e.timeStamp;\nlet visibleLength = this._selectLength(e.nativeEvent.layoutMeasurement);\nlet contentLength = this._selectLength(e.nativeEvent.contentSize);\nlet offset = this._selectOffset(e.nativeEvent.contentOffset);\nlet dOffset = offset - this._scrollMetrics.offset;\n\n// ...\n this._scrollMetrics = {\n      contentLength,\n      dt,\n      dOffset,\n      offset,\n      timestamp,\n      velocity,\n      visibleLength,\n    };\n\n```\n\nIf this is a vertical VirtualizedList, we get these layout info from `nativeEvent` event. The  `layout.layoutMeasurement.height` is the `viewportHeight`, `visibleLength`, the height of viewable region.  \n\n![5d152b82.png](/img/9af4f3b0-fe64-4a98-b94e-d456f65ae7cc/5d152b82.png)\n\n## ViewabilityHelperCallbackTuple\n\n```js\n_viewabilityTuples: Array<ViewabilityHelperCallbackTuple> = [];\n```\n\n`ViewabilityHelperCallbackTuple` is an array storing `ViewabilityHelper/onViewableItemsChanged` pairs\n\n```js\ntype ViewabilityHelperCallbackTuple = {\n  viewabilityHelper: ViewabilityHelper,\n  onViewableItemsChanged: (info: {\n    viewableItems: Array<ViewToken>,\n    changed: Array<ViewToken>,\n    ...\n  }) => void,\n  ...\n};\n```\n\nIf you define [viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist#viewabilityconfigcallbackpairs),  each `viewabilityConfig` will be used to initialize a different `ViewabilityHelper` object. \n\n[ref code](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/84adc85523770ebfee749a020920e0b216cf69f8/Libraries/Lists/VirtualizedList.js#L743). \n\n```js\n if (this.props.viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs) {\n      this._viewabilityTuples = this.props.viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs.map(\n        pair => ({\n          viewabilityHelper: new ViewabilityHelper(pair.viewabilityConfig),\n          onViewableItemsChanged: pair.onViewableItemsChanged,\n        }),\n      );\n    } else if (this.props.onViewableItemsChanged) {\n      this._viewabilityTuples.push({\n        viewabilityHelper: new ViewabilityHelper(this.props.viewabilityConfig),\n        onViewableItemsChanged: this.props.onViewableItemsChanged,\n      });\n    }\n\n```\n\nHere, `ViewabilityHelper` is `\na utility class for calculating viewable items based on the viewabilityConfig and metrics, like scroll position and layout.\n`\nFor a `VirtualizedList`, there would be several  `ViewabilityHelper` objects in `_viewabilityTuples`,  containing different `viewabilityConfig` to handle different viewability conditions.  \n\nThere are some important props in `ViewabilityHelper`. \n\n```js\nclass ViewabilityHelper {\n  _config: ViewabilityConfig;\n  _hasInteracted: boolean = false;\n  /* A set of `timeoutID`, used for memory management */\n  _timers: Set<number> = new Set();\n  // Indexs of the viewable items\n  _viewableIndices: Array<number> = [];\n  // A map for viewable items\n  _viewableItems: Map<string, ViewToken> = new Map();\n}\n\n```\n\nThere is a func `_updateViewableItems` called in many scenarios, like `onScroll` method. It will call `viewabilityHelper.onUpdate` to calculate the viewable items. \n\n```js\n_updateViewableItems(data: any) {\n    const {getItemCount} = this.props;\n\n    this._viewabilityTuples.forEach(tuple => {\n      tuple.viewabilityHelper.onUpdate(\n        getItemCount(data),\n        // contentOffset of the list \n        this._scrollMetrics.offset,\n        // 🌟 viewportHeight \n        this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength, \n        this._getFrameMetrics,\n        this._createViewToken,\n        tuple.onViewableItemsChanged,\n        this.state,\n      );\n    });\n  }\n\n```\n- `this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength` is used as `viewportHeight`\n- `this._createViewToken` is used to construct a `ViewToken` object, which contains `item` data, `index`, `key` and viewability of the `item`. \n\n- [this._getFrameMetrics](1864) is a function to get frame of the cell by index from  `this._frames` map. \n\n```js\n// The map storing the cell layout info\n{ [cellKey]: {\n      // offset of the item cell\n      offset: number, \n      // length of the item cell. width or height determined by the direction of the VirtualizedList\n      length: number, \n      index: number,\n      inLayout: boolean,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- Inside `this.state`, we know the range of the rendered items by  `first` and `last` value. \n\n```js\ntype State = {\n  // The range of the rendered items, \n  // used for the optimization to reduce the scan size\n  first: number,\n  last: number,\n  ...\n};\n```\n\n### 3. How to get viewable items\n \nIn `onUpdate` method, it calls `computeViewableItems` to get `viewableIndices` \n\n#### computeViewableItems\n\nIn `computeViewableItems`, it only go through the specific range of items, from `${first}` to `${last}`. If a item is viewable, it will be stored in an array named `viewableIndices`. \n\n```js\n  for (let idx = first; idx <= last; idx++) {\n      const metrics = getFrameMetrics(idx);\n      if (!metrics) {\n        continue;\n      }\n      // The top of current item cell, relative to the screen \n      const top = metrics.offset - scrollOffset;\n      // The bottom of current item cell \n      const bottom = top + metrics.length;\n      if (top < viewportHeight && bottom > 0) {\n        firstVisible = idx;\n        if (\n          _isViewable(\n            viewAreaMode,\n            viewablePercentThreshold,\n            top,\n            bottom,\n            viewportHeight,\n            metrics.length,\n          )\n        ) {\n          viewableIndices.push(idx);\n        }\n      } else if (firstVisible >= 0) {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    return viewableIndices;\n  }\n```\n\n![layout.png](/img/9af4f3b0-fe64-4a98-b94e-d456f65ae7cc/3252d60e.png)\n\n### 4. What kind of item is viewable? \n\n An item is said to be viewable when any of the following conditions\n  is true for longer than `minimumViewTime` milliseconds (after an interaction if `waitForInteraction`\n is true):\n \n1. the fraction of the item visible in the view area >= `itemVisiblePercentThreshold`.\nWhen it comes to the fraction of the item visible in the view area, \n there are following cases we need to care about. RN use `Math.min(bottom, viewportHeight) - Math.max(top, 0)` to calculate the viewable length. \n    \n  ![partial](viewable-partial.png)\n1.

In my case, they are yolo3-tiny.cfg and yolo3-tiny.weights \n\n\n## Parse the configuration file\n\n### Sections in the file \n\nThe code to parse the yolo.cfg file is here:\n\n```c\nlist *read_cfg(char *filename)\n{\n    FILE *file = fopen(filename, \"r\");\n    if(file == 0) file_error(filename);\n    char *line;\n    int nu = 0;\n    list *options = make_list();\n    section *current = 0;\n    while((line=fgetl(file)) != 0){\n        ++ nu;\n        strip(line);\n        switch(line[0]){\n            case '[':\n                current = malloc(sizeof(section));\n                list_insert(options, current);\n                current->options = make_list();\n                current->type = line;\n                break;\n            case '\\0':\n            case '#':\n            case ';':\n                free(line);\n                break;\n            default:\n                if(!read_option(line, current->options)){\n                    fprintf(stderr, \"Config file error line %d, could parse: %s\\n\", nu, line);\n                    free(line);\n                }\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n    fclose(file);\n    return options;\n}\n```\n\n\nfor exmaple: \n\n```js\n[net]              // '[' is a tag for a section, the type of current setion is '[net]'\n# Testing          // ignore\nbatch=1         \nsubdivisions=1\n# Training\n# batch=64\n# subdivisions=2\nwidth=416\nheight=416\nchannels=3\nmomentum=0.9\ndecay=0.0005\nangle=0\nsaturation = 1.5\nexposure = 1.5\nhue=.1\n                 // ignore\nlearning_rate=0.001\n...\n\n[convolutional]    // [convoltional] \n...\n\n[maxpool]      // [maxpool] \n\n...\n[yolo]\n...\n\n[route]\n...\n\n```\n\n#### `[net]`\n\nIn section '[net]', `batch=1` is a option stored in `kvp`(option_list.c line 70) structure. Its key is batch, value is 1. Then this kvp object will be inserted into a node list (see it at option_list.c line76 & list.c line 40).\nAfter parsing the yolo3-tiny.cfg file, We will get a section list; its size is 25. Because there are 25 \\'[\\' tags in yolo3-tiny.cfg\n\n\nIn `parse_network_cfg` function, it parses the `[net]` section to get the params for the whole network. \n\n```c\nnetwork *parse_network_cfg(char *filename)\n{\n    list *sections = read_cfg(filename);\n    node *n = sections->front;\n    if(!n) error(\"Config file has no sections\");\n    network *net = make_network(sections->size - 1);\n    // other codes ...\n    \n}\n```\n\n#### `[convolutional]`\n\nThen parse the different sections. \n\n```c\n        s = (section *)n->val;\n        options = s->options;\n        layer l = {0};\n        LAYER_TYPE lt = string_to_layer_type(s->type);\n        if(lt == CONVOLUTIONAL){\n            l = parse_convolutional(options, params);\n        }else if(lt == DECONVOLUTIONAL){\n            l = parse_deconvolutional(options, params);\n        }else if(lt == LOCAL){\n            l = parse_local(options, params);\n        }else if(lt == ACTIVE){\n            l = parse_activation(options, params);\n        // other code here ...\n       \n```\n\n\nFor the first `[convolutional]` section in the yolo3-tiny.cfg as follow, the darknet will construct a `convolutional_layer` using thess params (see function `parse_convolutional` in parse.c and  function `make_convolutional_layer` in convolutional_layer.c)\n\n```js\n[convolutional]\nbatch_normalize=1\nfilters=16\nsize=3\nstride=1\npad=1\nactivation=leaky\n```\n\nIn this layer, there are 16 filters; the size of each filter is 3X3Xnum_channel; what is num_channel? well, `the number of channels in a filter must match the number of channels in input volume`, so here num_channel is equal to 3. The stride value for filters is 1, padding value is 1. \n\n\nLet's see how darknet calculate the output size of convolutional_layer by the input size(`l.h`) and filter params (`l.size`, `l.pad`, `l.stride`). There is a formula that shows how size of input volume relates to the one of output volume\n \n\n```c\n\nint convolutional_out_height(convolutional_layer l)\n{\n    return (l.h + 2*l.pad - l.size) / l.stride + 1;\n}\n\nint convolutional_out_width(convolutional_layer l)\n{\n    return (l.w + 2*l.pad - l.size) / l.stride + 1;\n}\n\n```\n\n As for yolo3-tiny.cfg, for this first convolutional_layer, its input size is 416 x 416 and channel is 3. So its ouput height is (416+2x1 - 3)/1 + 1 = 416, its output width is 416 too. `What about its output channel? It equals to the number of filters (16)`. \n \n ```c\n \n  l.out_c = n    // in func make_convolutional_layer\n  \n ```\n So its output volume size is 416 X 416 X 16.\n \n \n ![02b028d9.png](/img/995676c2-24ed-4165-8224-0bc01148242a/9b76325f.png)\n \n For a beginner, I strongly recommend these courses: [Strided Convolutions - Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks \\| Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/strided-convolutions-wfUhx) and  [One Layer of a Convolutional Network - Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks \\| Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/one-layer-of-a-convolutional-network-nsiuW)\n  \nNow, we have 16 filters that are 3X3X3 in this layer, `how many parameters does this layer have`?  Each filter is a 3X3X3 volume, so it's 27 numbers tp be learned, and then plus the bias, so that was the b parameters. it's 28 parameters. There are 16 filters so that would be 448 parameters to be learned in this layer. \n \n```c\n\n    // c: the number of channels; n: the number of filters; \n    // size: the number of filter width or height; groups: default is 1 \n    l.weights = calloc(c/groups*n*size*size, sizeof(float));\n    l.weight_updates = calloc(c/groups*n*size*size, sizeof(float));\n\n    l.biases = calloc(n, sizeof(float));\n    l.bias_updates = calloc(n, sizeof(float));\n\n    l.nweights = c/groups*n*size*size;\n    l.nbiases = n;\n\n```\n \n \n#### Activation \n \n In this convolution layer, it choose leaky ReLU as activation function. The function is defined as follow  where α is a small constant.\n \n $$\nf(x)=\\begin{cases}\nαx,\\quad x\\leq 0 \\\\\\\\ \nx,\\quad x>0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n \n Still, I recommend this course for a beginner. [Activation functions - Shallow neural networks \\| Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/neural-networks-deep-learning/activation-functions-4dDC1)\n\n \nThere are `forward_activation_layer` and `backward_activation_layer` in Darknet. Both of them handle batch inputs. \n\nFor forward activation layer, leaky_activate is to computes f(x)\n\n ```c\n static inline float leaky_activate(float x){return (x>0) ? x : .1*x;}\n ```\n For backward activation layer, leaky_gradient returns the slop of the function \n\n```c\nstatic inline float leaky_gradient(float x){return (x>0) ? 1 : .1;}\n```\n\n\n \n \n#### [maxpool]\n \n Maxpool layer is used to reduce the size of representation to speed up computation as well as to make some of the features it detects a bit more robust. Look at the `tiny-yolo3.cfg`\n \n ```js\n [maxpool]\nsize=2\nstride=2\n\n ```\n ```c\n maxpool_layer make_maxpool_layer(int batch, int h, int w, int c, int size, int stride, int padding)\n{\n    maxpool_layer l = {0};\n    l.type = MAXPOOL;\n    l.batch = batch;\n    l.h = h;\n    l.w = w;\n    l.c = c;         // output channel equals to input one \n    l.pad = padding;  // default value is size - 1\n    l.out_w = (w + padding - size)/stride + 1;\n    l.out_h = (h + padding - size)/stride + 1;\n    l.out_c = c;\n    l.outputs = l.out_h * l.out_w * l.out_c;\n    // other codes ...\n    return l;\n}\n\n \n ```\n This `[maxpool]` sections comes after the `[convolutional]` section. Its input size(416 x 416 x 16) equal to the output size of the former layer (416 x 416 x  16). The filter size is 2 x 2, stride is 2. Each time, the filter would move 2 steps, for a 4x4x1 input volume, its output is 2x2x1 volume. \n![e65fb56d.png](/img/995676c2-24ed-4165-8224-0bc01148242a/e65fb56d.png)\n```\n9 == max(1, 3, 2, 9)\n2 == max(2, 1, 1, 1)\n6 == max(1, 3, 5, 6)\n3 == max(2, 3, 1, 2)\n```\nSo in this layer, its ouput width equals to (int)((416+ 1 - 2)/2 + 1), 208. And the number of its output channels equals to the number of input channels. Now, we know its output volume size is 208 X 208 X 16.

contains the claims. \nClaims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. \n```\n有三种[claims](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1): registered, public, and

如果我们没有捕获足够的光，那么相片就会`欠曝`:\n\n<img src=\"/img/15000130641224/15000133443588.jpg\" width = \"368\" height = \"500\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n\n\n- 如果我们捕获的光太多，图像就会`过曝`:\n\n<img src=\"/img/15000130641224/15000133832576.jpg\" width = \"368\" height = \"500\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n\n\n\n## 三个要素可以影响曝光的进光量\n\n- 快门速度\n- 光圈\n- 感光度 (ISO)\n\n![](/img/15000130641224/15006272782478.jpg)\n\n想象相机是黑暗房间，有个窗户（光圈）， 有块窗帘（快门），窗户越大进光量越大，窗帘拉开的时间越久。 窗户对面有面镜子（感官元件），捕获光子成像。\n\n## 1.快门速度\n当我们捕捉图片时，图像传感器需要捕捉一段时间的光。 这个时间段曝光时间（也叫快门速度。相机中一般用`1/400、8`这样的形式表示）这个数值越大，快门开启的时间越长，进入相机的光线就越多，但运动的物体很可能模糊.\n\n看下图： \n\n![](/img/15000130641224/15006271573170.jpg)\n\n\n## 2.感光度 (ISO)\n\n它被用来衡量图像传感器对光的`灵敏程度`，以及因此带来的曝光噪音。ISO越大，传感器越灵敏，捕获光能力越强，照片越亮，但噪点也越多。\n\n![](/img/15000130641224/15006272197963.jpg)\n\n####左： ISO 32 和 1/3 秒曝光\n####右： ISO 1600 和 1/180 秒\n![](/img/15000130641224/15000247388896.jpg)\n\n\n**图像传感器**\n这个部分就相当于我们眼睛里的视网膜。图像传感器可以将光或者光子转换为电信号。\n\n**图像传感器是由海量的独个的像素传感器串起来的巨大矩形区域** 我们可以将每个像素传感器想象成一个装电荷的桶。当光子撞击到像素传感器的光二极管时，它们将在这个像素的桶中缓慢地积攒电荷。最后，每个像素都会有它自己的一小桶电子。这些电荷的数量是依赖于光子数量的 -- 或者说是决定于打到这个特定的点上的光的强度。\n\n因为我们有一个像素传感器的二维阵列，我们现在就拥有能够反应出所有这些位置的光的强度的一组二维电荷阵列了。**在 iPhone 6 上，我们有八百万个这样的微小的像素传感器**，以及它们所对应的电荷桶。\n\n\n## 3.光圈\n\n相机的镜头的光圈(Aperture)是用来衡量到达图像感应器的光所通过的`通孔的大小`的\n\n\n#### 曝光值\n\n曝光值（Exposure Value，EV）代表能够给出同样曝光的所有相机光圈快门组合\n\n![](/img/15000130641224/15026013567638.jpg)\n其中N是光圈（f值）；t是曝光时间（快门），单位秒。曝光值0（EV0）对应于曝光时间为1秒而光圈为f/1.0的组合或其等效组合。\n\n`曝光值 != 曝光量`\n\n####曝光量（photometric exposure）\n\n![](/img/15000130641224/15026015278605.jpg)\n其中  H是曝光量， E是影像平面的照度，而  t是曝光时间。照度 E由f值所控制，但也取决于环境亮度。\n\n## 光圈与景深\n\n##### 景深\n\n![](/img/15000130641224/15026018990936.jpg)\n\n![](/img/15000130641224/15026016717518.jpg)\n\n![](/img/15000130641224/15026016975426.jpg)\n\n光圈系数= `镜头焦距/光圈孔径`；常用的镜头的光圈数序列为\n`1， 1.4， 2， 2.8， 4， 5.6， 8， 11， 16， 22， 32， 45， 64，90，128`\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["CV"]},{"title":"XMPP(3):Roster&联系人","url":"/2019/03/31/Roster-联系人/","content":"\n\n\n\nXMPP中联系人模块协议是`jabber:iq:roster`. Roster直接翻译叫花名册，其实它就是联系人列表啦。\n\n## 客户端获取联系人列表\n\n比较简单，发送IQ stanza给server. xmlns=`jabber:iq:roster`;type='get'\n\n```xml\n\n<iq from='user@server.com/balcony'\n       id='bv1bs71f'\n       type='get'>\n    <query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'/>\n  </iq>\n\n```\n返回结果的item中有联系人Jid\n\n```xml\n<iq id='bv1bs71f'\n       to='user@server.com/balcony'\n       type='result'>\n    <query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster' ver='ver7'>\n      <item jid='contact1@server.com'/>\n      <item jid='contact2@server.com'/>\n    </query>\n  </iq>\n\n```\n\n## 添加联系人(加好友）的流程 \n\n方法有两种，第一种用IQ set, 见[rfc6121](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html#roster-add).\n\n1. 客户端请求添加联系人\n\nxmlns用`jabber:iq:roster`;

type是'subscribe'。 我们可以用这条消息来做“收到来自user添加好友的请求”这样的功能\n```xml\n<presence from='user@server.com' to='contact@server.com' type='subscribe' xmlns='jabber:client'></presence>\n```\n\n同时contact/dev设备会收到Roster更新的信息. \n```xml\n<iq  from='contact@server.com' to='contact@server.com/dev' id='13a99ca5' type='result' xmlns='jabber:client'>\n    <query  xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'>\n         <item  ask='subscribe' subscription='none' jid='user@server.com'/>\n       </query>\n</iq>\n```\n#### 接受请求\n如果contact接受请求，他要发送一条presence给user. type值是'subscribed'\n\n```xml\n<presence to='user@server.com' type='subscribed'/>\n```\n\nuser这边的roster会更新\n```xml\n// user's roster\n<item subscription='to' jid='contact@server.com'/>\n```\n这时在contact的roster列表里，user的subscription是from。 ```xml\n// contact's roster\n<item ask='subscribe' subscription='from' jid='user@server.com'/>\n```\n\n接着contact也请求订阅user \n\n```xml\n<iq from='user@server.com/balcony' type='set' id='roster_2'>\n  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'>\n    <item jid='contact@server.com'\n          name='contact'>\n      <group>Servants</group>\n    </item>\n  </query>\n</iq>\n```\n\nContact同样流程后，他两的subscription都变成了both。\n\n#### 拒绝\n如果contact想拒绝user的请求，也是发送presence \n```xml\n<presence to='user@server.com' type='unsubscribed'/>\n```\n如果user想取消对contact的订阅, 发送presence stanza，type 是unsubscribed\n```xml\n<presence to='contact@server.com' type='unsubscribed'/>\n```\n\n\nref: https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3921.html#roster","tags":["XMPP"],"categories":["XMPP"]},{"title":"XMPP(2):注册账户","url":"/2019/03/29/XMPP-2-注册账户/","content":"\n\n\n## XMPP注册流程\n\n\n#### 1. client发送消息体, 去服务端查询注册需要的字段\n\n\n```xml\n<iq type='get' id='reg1' to='localhost'>\n  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'/>\n</iq>\n```\n\nxmlns是 `jabber:iq:register`, type是`get`\n\n#### 2.1. 未注册：返回注册需要的字段\n\n```xml\n<iq type='result' id='reg1'>\n  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'>\n    <instructions>\n      Choose a username and password for use with this service.\n      Please also provide your email address.\n    </instructions>\n    <username/>\n    <password/>\n    <email/>\n  </query>\n</iq>\n```\n\n`<instructions/>` element：SHOULD contain an <instructions/> element (whose XML character data MAY be modified to reflect the fact that the entity is currently registered)\n\n#### 2.2. 已注册：服务端的返回结果\n\n```xml\n<iq  xmlns='jabber:client' xml:lang='en' to='olivia@localhost/180244803852118156522754' from='localhost' type='result' id='reg1'>\n    <query  xmlns='jabber:iq:register'>\n        <username>olivia</username>\n        <registered/>\n        <password/>\n        <instructions>Choose a username and password to register with this server</instructions>\n    </query>\n</iq>\n```\n\nhost会根据\"from\"的地址判断entity是否已经注册了，IQ result消息有一个空的`<registered/>`， 标示该entiry已经注册过了。\n\n#### 3.client 注册 \n\niq stanza的type是`set`, xmlns`jabber:iq:register`\n\n```xml\n<iq type='set' id='reg2'>\n  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'>\n    <username>bill</username>\n    <password>Calliope</password>\n    <email>bard@shakespeare.lit</email>\n  </query>\n</iq>\n```\n\n#### 4.1 注册成功 \n\n```xml\n<iq type='result' id='reg2'/>\n\n```\n\n#### 4.2 注册失败，命名冲突\n\n```xml\n<iq type='error' id='reg2'>\n  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'>\n    <username>bill</username>\n    <password>m1cro$oft</password>\n    <email>billg@bigcompany.com</email>\n  </query>\n  <error code='409' type='cancel'>\n    <conflict xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/>\n  </error>\n</iq>\n```\n\n#### 4.3 消息不全 ` <not-acceptable/> `\n\n```xml\n<iq type='error' id='reg2'>\n  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'>\n    <username>bill</username>\n    <password>Calliope</password>\n  </query>\n  <error code='406' type='modify'>\n    <not-acceptable xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/>\n  </error>\n</iq>\n```\n\n#### 4.4 服务端访问权限问题\n\n```xml\n<iq  xmlns='jabber:client' xml:lang='en' to='olivia@localhost/180244803852118156522754' from='olivia@localhost' type='error' id='reg2'>\n    <query  xmlns='jabber:iq:register'>\n        <email>bard@shakespeare.lit</email>\n        <username>bill</username>\n        <password>Calliope</password>\n    </query>\n    <error  code='403' type='auth'>\n        <forbidden  xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/>\n        <text  xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas' xml:lang='en'>Access denied by service policy</text>\n    </error>\n</iq>\n```\n\n#### 5.如果用第三方注册的方式，可能需要补充一些额外的信息\n\n客户端查询\n\n```xml\n<iq type='get'\n    from='juliet@capulet.com/balcony'\n    to='contests.shakespeare.lit'\n    id='reg3'>\n  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'/>\n</iq>\n```\n\n#### 6.服务端返回消息， 提示需要提供的信息\n\n```xml\n<iq type='result'\n    from='contests.shakespeare.lit'\n    to='juliet@capulet.com/balcony'\n    id='reg3'>\n  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'>\n    <instructions>\n      Use the enclosed form to register.

Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols)\n\n\n## XMPP Addressing \n\n这是一张Client-Server的图，图里的server、client都遵循XMPP协议。叫 XMPP entity. 它们有各自唯一的Address, 格式如'username@server.com', 叫 JID (Jaber ID)\n [RFC 7622 - Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Address Format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7622/)\n \n ![28a215f7.png](/img/32c16f22-9862-45e8-b15f-1b1eceb7b30f/28a215f7.png)\n \n其中resource是拿来做同一账号多客户端标记的， 比如图中`User1` 从 pc ,phone1 和 phone2登录同一账号，resource分别是 `pc`, `iphone1`,`iphone2`\n \n \n ## XMPP Client- Server Streams\n \n 客户端与服务端通过长链接方式通信，现在多用WebSocket。当客户端跟服务端握手成功，它们开始用 XML stream通信。\n \n ![f1565a2e.png](/img/32c16f22-9862-45e8-b15f-1b1eceb7b30f/f1565a2e.png)\\\n\n \nXML stream 总是以  ``<stream>`` 开头， ``</stream>`` tag结尾。是xml消息的容器。\n\n```\nAn XML stream is a container for the exchange of XML elements between any two entities over a network. \nDuring the life of the stream, the entity that initiated it can send an unbounded number of XML elements over the stream, either elements used to negotiate the stream (e.g., to complete TLS negotiation or SASL negotiation) or XML stanzas. \n```\n\n下面是client跟server的一次消息交互， 绿色来自client的，黑色消息来自server\n\n \n  ![f97e583b.png](/img/32c16f22-9862-45e8-b15f-1b1eceb7b30f/65d38868.png)\n\n ### XML stanza\n An XML stanza is the basic unit of meaning in XMPP. A stanza is a first-level element (at depth=1 of the stream) whose element name is \"message\", \"presence\", or \"iq\" and whose qualifying namespace is 'jabber:client' or 'jabber:server'. \n \n \n ### XMPP Communication Primitives\n\nA `stanza` is the smallest piece of XML data a client can send to a server ( server send to client) in one package.\n\nxmpp中，服务端、客户数据交换时，最小XML数据单位 叫 stanza。如上图，绿色的就是一个stanza，黑色的也是一个stanza。Stanza有几种类型: `message`, `iq`, `presence`。 \n\n#### The Message Stanza\n\nThe <message/> stanza is meant to be used to send data between XMPP entities.\n\n![6fe8a15e.png](/img/32c16f22-9862-45e8-b15f-1b1eceb7b30f/6fe8a15e.png)\n\n - from：发送方\n - to： 接收方\n - body: 消息内容\n - type 有几种类型:\n     -`<message type=”chat”/>` ( chat message stanza) \n     - `< message type=”groupchat”/>` ( groupchat message stanza)\n     - `< message type=”error”/>` (error message stanza)\n\n#### The Presence Stanza\n\n用来表示在线状态的\n \n\n![0fbe995b.png](/img/32c16f22-9862-45e8-b15f-1b1eceb7b30f/0fbe995b.png)\n\n`show` 标签里可能会有的几种状态: \n`chat` : online and available for chat ; \n`away` : 暂时离开\n`xa` : 长时间离开\n`dnd`: 请勿打扰\n\n如果你想知道别的状态，需要先发消息给Server，subscribe别人。 \n\n\n#### The IQ stanza\n \n The IQ( Info/Query) stanza is used to get some information from the server ( info about the server or its registered clients) or to apply some settings to the server.\n \n 用来获取消息，或者请求设置\n  \nType属性中的类型 :get ,set ,result or error. \n- `< iq type=”get”/>` stanzas are used to get(ask) some information ( from the server). \n- `<iq type=”set”/>` stanzas are used to apply some settings to the server.When you send get/set IQ stanzas to the server ,\n- it can reply either with an `< iq type=”result”/>` stanza when your request has been successfully processed by the server or \n- `<iq type=”error”/>` stanza when something has gone wrong with your request.The figure below shows an IQ stanza that we send to the server and the reply we get from the server.\n\n\n![30c96f66.png](/img/32c16f22-9862-45e8-b15f-1b1eceb7b30f/30c96f66.png)\n\n\nThe client sends an IQ get stanza to the server to request its contact list.We know it is asking for the contact list because of the `jabber:iq:roster` XML namespace.\n\nThe XMPP engine in the server is programmed to know that when a client sends `jabber:iq:roster` namespaced IQ ,it wants to retrieve its contact list.There are other `namespaces` in XMPP for other uses and you will surely come accross them in your XMPPing journey.\n\nThe server responds with a list of the JID’s contacts wraped within a `jabber:iq:roster` namespaced `<query/>`tag.\n\n\n## 本地搭建 Server \n\n我搭的是ejabberd. 官方安装教程: [Installing ejabberd \\| ejabberd Docs](https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/installation/#install-on-macos)\n\n#### 启动服务\n\n```\ncd /Applications/ejabberd-19.02\n//开启服务\n./bin/ejabberdctl start  \n//状态\n./bin/ejabberdctl status  \n\n// help 查看更多功能哦\n./bin/ejabberdctl help \n```\n\n#### 注册账户\n\n打开 [admin 页面](http://localhost:5280/admin/), 虚拟主机 -> localhost(可能你的名字不一样) -> 用户。 现在你可以自己创建账户了。\n\n![578b88b6.png](/img/32c16f22-9862-45e8-b15f-1b1eceb7b30f/578b88b6.png)\n\n\n如果有自定义需求,配置教程 [Configuring ejabberd \\| ejabberd Docs](https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/configuration/#mod-http-ws) \n \n#### 客户端玩起来\n\n客户端有很多[选择](https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html)，不过大多数都是渣。如果是WebSocket，用这个 [GitHub - processone/xmpp-websocket-client: Test XMPP Websocket client](https://github.com/processone/xmpp-websocket-client) 调试可以看到stanza，挺方便的。\n\n如果Mac用户报auth问题，可以打开`vim conf/ejabberd.yml`, `tls`配置成`false`\n![5202ee46.png](/img/32c16f22-9862-45e8-b15f-1b1eceb7b30f/5202ee46.png)\n\n#### 关于js lib\n打算用React Native写，lib选了 [GitHub - xmppjs/xmpp.js: XMPP for JavaScript](https://github.com/xmppjs/xmpp.js) 。当然 Web多用框架 Strophe.js。这儿有个简单比较[How do you compare to strophe.js · Issue #217 · xmppjs/xmpp.js · GitHub](https://github.com/xmppjs/xmpp.js/issues/217)\n\n### 其他资料\n\n- 简单介绍 [A friendly introduction to XMPP – blikoon](https://www.blikoontech.com/xmpp/xmpp-a-soft-friendly-introduction)\n\n- 官方协议很详细，例子也很形象。 [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#tls)\n\n- 如何选择即时通讯应用的数据传输格式 [如何选择即时通讯应用的数据传输格式-其它分享/专项技术区 - 即时通讯开发者社区!](http://www.52im.net/thread-276-1-1.html)\n- 强列建议将Protobuf作为你的即时通讯应用数据传输格式 [强列建议将Protobuf作为你的即时通讯应用数据传输格式-其它分享/专项技术区 - 即时通讯开发者社区!](http://www.52im.net/thread-277-1-1.html) \n\n\n\n\n","tags":["XMPP"],"categories":["NetWork"]}]
